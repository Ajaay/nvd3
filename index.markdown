## About

nvd3.js is an attempt to build reusable chart components for d3.js without
ruining the essense behind d3.js. This is a very young collection of components,
with the goal of keeping these components away from your standard cookie cutter
solutions.  d3.js gives you the power to build any data visualization you can 
imagine in two dimensions utilizing SVG and HTML, hopefully nvd3.js won't limit 
you from any of this power. This collection will be rapidly expanding, and we'll 
be doing our best to produce reusable charts ready for a production environment.  
We appreciate any help, whether you're a JavaScript maniac, or a random user who 
can point out a bug or two.
